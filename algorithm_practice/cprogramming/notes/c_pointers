[Introduction]
Pointer is simply a variable that stores the address where a piece of data resides in memory.
Pointers store memory addresses.
e.g
int *ptr;

ptr-----> 0x02345678  	0x00000000
			0x00000008
			0x00000016
			.
			.
			.
			0x02345678 <10>

A pointer points to nothing at all -- that is when it is set to NULL.
As with other types of variables, we should not assume that a pointer points anywhere 
useful until we explicitly set it.
It is also important to remember that nothing prevents a pointer in C from pointing to an 
invalid address.
Pointers that point to invalid addresses are sometimes called dangling pointers.
Some examples of programming errors that can lead to dangling pointers
---- casting arbitrary integers to pointers
---- adjusting pointers beyond the bounds of arrays,
---- deallocating storage that one or more pointers still reference


When we declare a pointer in C, a certain amount of space is allocated for it,
just as for other types of variables.
Pointers generally occupy one machine word, but their size can vary.
